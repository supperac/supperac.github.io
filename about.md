This is a blog where I will post about the steps I take in learning data analytics. I started out clean, not knowing anything about this field. I have been learning python on and off since 2017 feburary. I can not say that I'm in love with this language but I do love the feels it gives me when I complete a task or a project. 

It cost me almost 3 hours to establish this blog, it is not easy...<br>
anyways, I will keep updating what I will accomplish or some notes or guides.

and yeah...I need to read more english books, my enlighs writing has weakened.<br>
