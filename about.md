This is a blog where I post about the steps I take in learning data analytics. I started out clean, not knowing anything about this field. I have been learning python on and off since 2017 feburary. I can not say that I'm in love with this language but I do love the feels it gives me when I complete a task or a project. 

It cost me almost 3 hours to build up this blog, it is not easy...<br>
anyway, I will keep updating what I complete or some notes or guides.

and yeah...I now feel the need to spend more time on reading english books, my enligsh writing skill has ummmm...<br>
